To improve the educational process at the Mixed High School Bugojno, Nursing Technician program, it is crucial to establish a stimulating environment for teacher education and the development of talented students. We focus on implementing new didactic tools and educating students about artificial intelligence in medical practice to familiarize them with advanced technologies. This initiative aims to enhance the quality of education and prepare students for future challenges by creating a stimulating environment for teachers and continuous improvement of teaching methods with a focus on the application of artificial intelligence.

Collaboration with the Scientific Research Institute Verlab for Biomedical Engineering, Medical Devices, and Artificial Intelligence will enable teacher education on practical tool application and mentoring for integrating artificial intelligence education into the curriculum. Recognizing young talents and supporting them through additional classes and workshops will allow them to gain a deeper understanding of new technologies, with opportunities to participate in research projects or competitions through cooperation with the Verlab Institute. In this way, young talents will be motivated to continue their education and become leaders in the field.
